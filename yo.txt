In this code, we define an Item struct that represents the data we want to expose through the API. We then create a slice of Item values, and add some example items to it.

We define two route handlers using the http.HandleFunc function. The first route handler, /items, returns the list of items as JSON when a GET request is made. The second route handler, /items/add, accepts a new item in the request body and adds it to the slice when a POST request is made.

Finally, we start the server by calling http.ListenAndServe and passing in nil as the handler. This causes the default router to be used, which routes requests to the registered route handlers.
